Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.
It includes over 700 problems, with a new one added once every one or two weeks. This repository shows my solutions of some of them.
Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.

Easy problems (Time spent on problem is less than 20 minutes.)= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,13,14,16,20,25,30,34,35,36,40,42,48]

Intermediate problems (Time spent on problem is less than 60 minutes.) = [12,]

Hard problems(Time spent on problem is over 60 minutes.) = [11,28]
