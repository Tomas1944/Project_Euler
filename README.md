Project_EulerProject Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.
It includes over 700 problems, with a new one added once every one or two weeks. This repository shows my solutions of some of them.
Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.
